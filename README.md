## How to Play

This snake has got some hustle -- it doesn't stop moving forward. You can however tell it where to go. Move up, left, down and right to collect apples and grow your snake, but be careful. If your snake runs into itself, it will die.

This snake has space-warping powers. If you leave the board on one side, it comes out from the other!

## Controls

* W / I / Up-Arrow: Move snake up
* A / J / Left-Arrow: Move snake left
* S / K / Down-Arrow: Move snake down
* D / L / Right-Arrow: Move snake right
